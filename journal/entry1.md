# Journal Entry DOET: The Psychology of Everyday Things

Below are notes from the reading that resonated with with me. 
Ultimately, you only have one opportunitey to move your product/item into the public space. If there are issues with usuablity it will likely fail. You would expect that when building a new product, users would be polled to ensure their needs are considered. This is not the case most of the time, which means the object will be over engineered and likely not useful or easy to use.

### Affordances & Signifiers
Something designed well shouldn't need instructions on how to use it, regardless of the object. Elements required to make the object work should be visible, so the user doesn't struggle to use it. "Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things" (p.9) and signifiers provide additional details of how and where to interact with the object, deliberately. 

An example of an object that suggests how it's used would be a frying pan. The handle is the smaller, narrow side, which is held by hand, and the larger bowl area indicates where you would place the contents you want to cook over the fire. The signifiers for this pan would be the non-stick coating inside the pan area and the ergonomic grip on the handle. 

Designers should focus on signifiers or the details of the experience, prioritizing the elements that are used most often.

### Conceptual Models
A conceptual model is formed by either forming an opinion or predicting how something is used, such as by looking at a diagram, how it's built, or mapped. This is similar to the car example, where the Mercedes-Benz seat controls are shaped like the seat itself. "A device is easy to use when there is visibility of the possible set of actions"(p.25)  

### Feedback
Feedback is essential in design, for example, on the latest version of iOS (v26). On the lock screen, in addition to highlighting each number when the user taps it, there is also haptic feedback, providing both visual and tactile feedback. If a user acts on something, there is an expectation of a response; otherwise, they may think the item is broken or the system is down.

### The Paradox of Technology
"What good is technology if it is too complex to use?"(p.30)
