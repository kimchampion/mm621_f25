# Journal Entry DOET: Chapter 5

Norman talks about how most “human errors” are caused by poor design, not users. He explains the differences between slips and mistakes. Good design can circumvent and allow recovery from both. We need systems that anticipate errors, give feedback, provide constraints, minimize complexity, and avoid blaming users for bad design.


Reading this chapter made me think about how many everyday mistakes aren’t really “my fault” but the result of confusing, complex systems.  Like reaching for a light switch in a house and flipping the wrong one three times because the switches all look the same, I still do this all the time in my house. There are multiple switches in my hallway, and I swear I always flip the incorrect one no matter what.  The design should be intuitive. My intention is right, but the design sets me up to slip.  Norman’s point is that these errors are predictable, and good design should work like a clear road sign or a helpful guardrail, guiding us before things go wrong.
