# Journal Entry DOET: Chapter 4 Knowing What to Do (pp 141-161)

In this part of the chapter, Norman used the history of faucet design to explain three big ideas: discoverability, natural mapping, and feedback.

- Discoverability helps you see what to do.
- Natural mapping feels right when the controls match what you expect to happen.
- Feedback lets you know that something actually happened after you act.

Norman shows that good design should make something simple and natural that you shouldn’t need instructions to figure out.

This section also talks about sound as a signifier and a way design can communicate through hearing, not just sight. He used electric cars as an example. Because they’re so quiet, pedestrians and cyclists often can’t hear them coming, and even drivers may not realize the car is “on.” So while electric cars are great for the environment, they weren’t very good at communicating with the outside world.

To fix this, car companies began adding artificial sounds to help people hear when the car is moving or reversing, preventing accidents and improving safety. Norman’s point is that design isn’t just about looks. It’s about communicating clearly through all our senses. Good design gives us the clues we need to understand what’s happening around us, even when those clues aren’t obvious.
